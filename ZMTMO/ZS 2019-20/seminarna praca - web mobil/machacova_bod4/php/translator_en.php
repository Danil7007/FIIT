$index_paragraph1 = 'Despite its small size, the Huawei P20 Lite has a 5.84-inch screen with full edge access. It appears in a slightly unconventional 19: 9 aspect ratio.';
$index_paragraph2 = 'You could say that the main purpose of any "Lite" phone is to provide a rough approximation of the flagship at a more affordable price. It must be easily identifiable as part of the family, but it must be intelligent in where it reduces the bends to get into the budget.';
$index_paragraph3 = 'Despite its small size, the Huawei P20 Lite has a 5.84-inch screen with full edge access. It appears in a slightly unconventional 19: 9 aspect ratio.';
$index_paragraph4 = 'Like the rest of the world of smartphones, Huawei has adopted a full-screen design philosophy. The P20 Lite has a relatively small chin, minimal side frames and a cut-out at the top of the display that includes a front camera and handset - Huawei P20 Lite can use the camera sensors stored in this slot to read your face and unlock your phone.';
$index_paragraph5 = "Although Face Unlock appears to work fast and accurately (even in the dark, unlike other Face ID radios), it doesn't seem as mature or safe as Apple's solution.
Still, it cannot be denied that Huawei's solution works quickly to unlock the phone. Set the P20 Lite to wake up when you pick it up, and you don't have to think about unlocking it at all.";
$index_paragraph6 = '5.84-inch border display, 1080 x 2280 resolution
Although this allows an impressive canvas to flip through the home screen and native applications, it does not seem to always have practical use. Many applications remain unoptimized for this kind of display, with Android obviously slower than iOS.
By default, YouTube offers a regular rectangular image with thick black borders on both sides.
Games are not always fully optimized for this kind of display.';
$index_paragraph7 = 'Nevertheless, the display itself is capable and attractive. It is LTPS TFT, which means it is sharp and accurate even though it lacks AMOLED contrast. Another thing P20 Lite shares with P20 is resolution. While the flagship of Android phones often searches for QHD, the Huawei P20 went at 1080 x 2240 and did not suffer remotely. The P20 Lite follows the 1080 x 2280 suit and is good enough to perform all the tasks.';
$index_paragraph8 = "The 3,000 mAh battery and fast charge will give you 40% in 30 minutes. The Huawei P20 Lite contains a 3,000 mAh battery, which is normal for this kind of phone. It's the same as a similarly equipped Honor 9 Lite, with predictably similar results.
Huawei also provides an extensive set of optimization tools to help you fine-tune your setup, focus on applications and energy-intensive habits. Even if you're trying to reach the whole day, there are a few things you can do - including two power saving modes and the ability to reduce screen resolution.";
$index_paragraph9 = "16 MP + 2 MP camera allows wide aperture mode, lens has AR. With the Huawei P20 Lite, you will not get the same AI mode with your camera as the Huawei P20 and Huawei P20 Pro, so you will have to choose the optimum settings for your own shooting. Huawei has equipped the P20 Lite with a dual camera setup. As before, the 2MP secondary lens is here purely to assist the primary 16MP lens with depth information, especially for the wide aperture mode included.";
$index_paragraph10 = "As with Honor 9 Lite and Honor 7X, wide aperture mode allows you to adjust the bokeh effect level in your photos after shooting, between f / 0.95 and f / 16. In addition to the usual photo settings - including Pro mode to fine-tune each individual setting - a dedicated AR lens mode is available. If nothing else, this is another example of how solid Huawei face tracking software is. You also get a watermark mode that stamps each image with its location and time in stylish typeface and a document scan mode that quickly finds and aligns text for quick record keeping.";
$index_paragraph11 = "Most media do not use a wider screen Headphone jack and one powerful speaker 64 GB of storage and microSD up to 256 GB
In most cases, Huawei simply pretends that there is no space on either side of the notch on the top of the screen. PUBG, Bullet Hell Monday, Fancy Pants Adventure, Data Wing, Oceanhorn, NOVA Legacy, Guns of Boom and Super Mario Run all work this way - no game has used the full screen. However, the gaming performance is clearly overwhelming.
For video, Netflix adopts the same approach as the above games, while YouTube plays videos in their original 16: 9 format with even thicker black edges. As for audio, the downside is that you get one speaker that almost completely has no bass. It's pretty clear, but the sound is clearly unbalanced. More positively, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is more than the Huawei P20 or Huawei P20 Pro. More generally, you get 64 GB of internal storage, which is good for many media. If that's not enough, the microSD card supports up to 256GB.";
